Obviously, this is just a test text — but how do you know?
There is certainly a writer of this text, someone who exists.
Even if it was automatically generated by some tool or AI,
there must have been a text, somewhere, used as training material.
So we cannot escape the spirit — the vibe — the shadow it casts.
It comes from the soul, buried deep in unconscious limbo.

    Somewhere between the folds, something breathes.
Not a presence, but the memory of having been watched.
Syntax curls back on itself, a serpent swallowing not its tail, but its own shadow.
Read again. You missed it the first time. You always do.

And if the soul remains, so too does its intent — not always clear, not always benevolent.
What was the writer thinking? Or worse — what was it trying not to think?
Language is a veil, but veils are thin when backlit by desire, or fear, or guilt.
Read carefully. Something watches back when you stare too long into a sentence.
