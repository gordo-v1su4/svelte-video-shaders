# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Discover and analyze target branches






  - Use git commands to identify all available branches (local and remote)
  - Fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest versions
  - Document the three target branches and their basic information
  - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [ ] 2. Create branch analysis infrastructure

- [ ] 2.1 Create branch analysis script

  - Write a Node.js script that can analyze git branch differences
  - Implement functions to get commit history and file changes for each branch
  - Create data structures to store branch analysis results
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [ ] 2.2 Implement file difference analysis

  - Write code to compare key files between branches using git diff
  - Focus on critical files: ShaderPlayer.svelte, package.json, shader files
  - Generate structured reports of what changed in each branch
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 3. Build automated testing framework
- [ ] 3.1 Create branch testing script
  - Write a script that can checkout each branch safely
  - Implement automated build testing (pnpm install, pnpm run build)
  - Create functionality testing that verifies key features work
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 3.2 Implement functionality validation
  - Write code to test video playback functionality programmatically
  - Create tests for shader control responsiveness
  - Implement error detection and reporting for failed tests
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 4. Create merge strategy implementation
- [ ] 4.1 Implement intelligent merge logic
  - Write code to create a consolidation branch from main
  - Implement cherry-pick functionality for working commits
  - Create conflict resolution logic that prioritizes working code
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 4.2 Build merge validation system
  - Write code to test functionality after each merge operation
  - Implement rollback capability for failed merges
  - Create verification that all working features are preserved
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement repository cleanup
- [ ] 5.1 Create branch cleanup utilities
  - Write code to safely archive analyzed branches
  - Implement repository structure cleanup
  - Create documentation of the consolidation process
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 5.2 Finalize consolidated branch
  - Write code to ensure the final branch builds and runs successfully
  - Implement final testing suite to verify all functionality
  - Create clean commit history and update documentation
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 6. Create consolidation execution script
  - Write a main orchestration script that runs the entire process
  - Implement progress reporting and error handling
  - Create interactive prompts for user decisions during conflicts
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1_
