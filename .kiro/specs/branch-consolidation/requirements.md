# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves analyzing three separate GitHub branches to identify which functionality is working correctly, then consolidating the best working code into a single clean main branch. The goal is to create a unified codebase that incorporates all functional features while eliminating broken or redundant code.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze the differences between three GitHub branches, so that I can understand what functionality exists in each branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the branch analysis is initiated THEN the system SHALL identify all three target branches
2. WHEN comparing branches THEN the system SHALL show file differences between each branch and the current HEAD
3. WHEN analyzing code changes THEN the system SHALL highlight functional differences in key files
4. IF a branch contains unique functionality THEN the system SHALL document what that functionality provides

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the functionality in each branch, so that I can determine which features are working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing each branch THEN the system SHALL allow switching between branches safely
2. WHEN running tests on a branch THEN the system SHALL execute the build process and identify any errors
3. WHEN functionality testing is performed THEN the system SHALL document which features work in each branch
4. IF a branch has working functionality THEN the system SHALL record the specific working components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to merge the best working code from all branches, so that I can create a single consolidated branch with all functional features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN merging branches THEN the system SHALL preserve all working functionality from each branch
2. WHEN conflicts arise during merge THEN the system SHALL prioritize the working implementation
3. WHEN consolidating code THEN the system SHALL remove any broken or redundant implementations
4. WHEN the merge is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure the consolidated branch builds and runs successfully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up the repository after consolidation, so that I have a single clean main branch without unnecessary branch clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN the system SHALL create a clean main branch with all working features
2. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL safely archive or remove the analyzed branches
3. WHEN the cleanup is finished THEN the system SHALL ensure the repository has a clear branch structure
4. IF any important branch history needs preservation THEN the system SHALL document the consolidation process
